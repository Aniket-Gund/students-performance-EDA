# students-performance-EDA

🚀 Project Objective
To conduct an exploratory data analysis of the student performance dataset to understand the overall distribution of academic scores and identify key factors influencing student outcomes.

This analysis will focus on:

Overall Performance: Establishing a baseline understanding of student performance by examining the distribution of math scores.

Demographic Composition: Quantifying the demographic makeup of the dataset, specifically the distribution of students by gender.

Identifying Disparities: Investigating potential variations in academic performance (in both math and reading) by comparing average scores and score distributions across different demographic and preparatory groups, including:

Gender

Race/Ethnicity

Test preparation course completion

The ultimate goal is to uncover patterns and insights into how these factors correlate with academic success, highlighting any significant performance gaps or advantages within the dataset.
